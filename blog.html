                <h3>Iphone Experience</h3>
                <p>Iphone features stand out for me . The camera is incredible, it can take colourful photos in low exposure. I often find myself taking random pictures just because they turn out so good. Face ID is another feature I can’t live without, I use it even when I have to make payments much easier and quicker.</p>
                 
                <h3>Ai Tools</h3>
                <p>Using Ai has helped me with my schoolwork and research and it has made me understand things better. I use it when I need help, advice what makes it so much better is I can even use my mother tongue to explain if I feel like I am don't understanding.</p>
